# calendar
Calendar made for task by b2match.

React aplication for display of commits in calendar.

Plesae when testing the app use your own personal token for API access as mine is no longer valid.
You can change personal token in src/App.js under const octokit -> auth.
Also feel free to change const owner and const repo variables to fetch commits from other repositories.
